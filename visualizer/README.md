# Usage :
> This visualizer works by reading json files created with SERDE;
> Interacting with the visualizer is possible by using the function "save" which will create a .json file into a folder where the visualizer can read.
> The function save takes as input a Vec<(i32,f64)> and the desired name of file *(no extension needed in it)*
