# Purpose :
> This is a visualizer for the data generated by the program. It is a simple widget that can render the data generated by the strategies.

# Usage : 
> This visualizer works by reading json files created with SERDE;
> Interacting with the visualizer is possible by using the function 
> `save(activities : &[(i32,f64)],filename : &str);`\
> which will create a .json file into a folder where the visualizer can read.\
> 
>### P.S
> 
> If the signature of the function seem confusing, you can simply see it as a vector of tuples of (i32,f64) : the first element is the nÂ° of the operation, while the second one shows the balance of the trader after the operation was executed.
> 
> The filename doesn't need an extension, it will be added automatically.

# Example :
> The following code is an example of how to use the visualizer.\
>  `let ops = vec![(0, 10.0),(3, 42.1),(2, 37.4)];`
>  `save(&ops,"save_test");`
> This is sufficient to create a file named save_test.json, which can be read by the visualizer.\
> The created file can be found in this path : \

> ### P.S
> For now the visualizer can only read one file at a time, I haven't implemented an effective way to change the selected file to read. 
> You can stay assured the usage is correct if you can manage to create a json file with the correct format. 
# Testing :
> The visualizer is tested checking the effectiveness of **save**, checking if the file was created and then controlling it with **read** . 
> For the plotting the only test is to check if the plot renders correctly.

# Result :
### Something similar should appear, showing the data on a widget :
